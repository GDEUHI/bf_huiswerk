# 📘 BF_programming Projects – 30-Day Learning Challenge

Welcome to my repository **`bf_huiswerk`**, which means *homework* in Dutch. This is a personal programming journal where I track my learning in C# as part of a structured 4-week (20-day) coding challenge.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Practice **daily C# programming** using Visual Studio
- Improve logic, structure, and code clarity
- Learn and reinforce **.NET fundamentals**
- Build confidence through repetition and hands-on problem-solving
- Maintain clean and version-controlled projects using Git and GitHub

I will be creating one program **each weekday (Monday to Friday)** for 4 weeks — totaling **20 exercises**. Each exercise will be written and explained clearly *within the code files themselves*.
